In this project, we will create a simple and basic serverless application, it takes a the registration data and uses lambda to update the table in aws dynamodb.

Here are the steps

1. Create DynamoDb Table
2. Create Lambda function with the code and IAM role
3. Create api gateway
4. Test the application
5. Clean up the resources

# 5. Clean up

So far we created 3 resources api gateway,lambda and dynamodb... go to the console page of each resource that was create and click delete on the top right.
